# TMDB React App

This project is a React App that consumes a TMDB API. Users can interact with data from the API in the following ways:

1. List view - Input a query into the search bar to get a list of shows that match the query. Results can be sorted by title or rating in ascending and descending order. When clicking on a show, the page is redirected to a details view of that show.

2. Gallery view - This view displays show posters that match the genre in the dropdown. When clicking on a show, the page is redirected to a details view of that show.

3. Detail view - When an item in the search or gallery view is clicked, the detail view shows additional information about the show. The arrow buttons allow cycling through the list of shows returned from the API.
